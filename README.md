# Implementation of Univariate Linear Regression
## Aim:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
2.	Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
3.	Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula.

4.	Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:
![eqn2](./eq2.jpg)  
5.	Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line.
6.	Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.

X = np.array(eval(input()))
Y = np.array(eval(input()))

# Building the model

X_mean = np.mean(X)
Y_mean = np.mean(Y)
num = 0
den = 0
for i in range(len(X)):
	num += (X[i] - X_mean)*(Y[i] - Y_mean)
	den += (X[i] - X_mean)**2
m = num / den
c = Y_mean - m*X_mean

# write your code here

print (m, c)
Y_pred = m*X + c

#Predict the output
print (Y_pred)
